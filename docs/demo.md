# Demo

Get started without having to install **Morph-KGC** with the **[`ONLINE DEMO`](https://morph.oeg.fi.upm.es/demo/morph-kgc)**.

The demo allows to create **[RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/)** knowledge graphs from data files (**[CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values)**, **[XML](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/)**, **[JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)**) using the **[YARRRML](https://rml.io/yarrrml/spec/)** mapping syntax via a web service.

You just need to:

1. Create a **[YARRRML](https://rml.io/yarrrml/spec/)** mapping.
2. **[Zip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format))** your data files (**[CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values)**, **[XML](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/)**, **[JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)**).
3. Upload your **[YARRRML](https://rml.io/yarrrml/spec/)** mapping and your zipped files.
4. **Materialize!** and download the **[RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/)** knowledge graph
